# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project is to create a webpage that will contain a table with the UFO data stored as JavaScript array. The table icludes filters by date, city, state, country, and shape to assist users the various type of information needed. In addition, we used HTMl, Bootsrap and CSS to create an appealing and user firendly webpage.


## Results
Below is the UFO Sightings webpage and the html preview.

## Summary

Drawbacks:

* After instering the filter criteria, a person must hit enter for filtering to incur. Unless this is known, there is no information to make someone aware of that necessary step.
* Case sensitivity is another drawback. The filtering criteria must match exactly with the data, including lower and upper case data details. In cases of slight mismatch, the result table will be empty.


Recommandations:

* We could add a statement that instructs user to press enter after completing the filtering criteria.
* We could create a click-button at the end of the filter search to extract results instead of using enter.
* We could create a button that clears the filtered data.
* We could remove the case-sensitivity or lower the percentage match to get better results.
